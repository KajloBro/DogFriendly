                        receipt) If necessary, the agency delay answering the client if the complaint requires more 
                        time to collect information. The client will be informed about the delay. The Agency will 
                        take into consideration only those complaints for which the traveller has submitted a proof 
                        that they sent a written complaint about the service provider on the spot and that could not 
                        be solved on the spot. If Agency is responsible for the failure of the program or a part of 
                        it, the passenger is entitled to a compensation of the actual level of unused services, and 
                        cannot include services already provided or the total amount. While the agency does not provide 
                        a solution about your complain, the passenger renounces

                    <h3>PRIVACY STATEMENT:</h3>
                    <p>All payments will be effected in Croatian currency. The amount your credit card account will be charged for is 
                        obtained through the conversion of the price in Euro into Croatian kuna according to the current exchange rate 
                        of the Croatian National bank. When charging your credit card, the same amount is converted into your local currency 
                        according to the exchange rate of credit card associations. As a result of this conversion there is a possibility of 
                        a slight difference from the original price stated in our web site.</p>
                    <p class="space_bot">At the moment it is possible to select only Croatian kuna as payment currency.</p>
